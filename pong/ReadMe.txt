Adapted from the Brackeys.com 2D Game tutorial by Eric Miller on 2-17-2018




Description: 

This is my attempt at the Brackeys Unity Tutorial for a 2D pong game. The tutorial series was done in Javascript, however I adapted it to use C# scripting instead. The original video tutorial series can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h-z0AyG42k&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4_IYZY2V0G3IUYcx1zZkJe
